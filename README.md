[![Latest Release][release]][release] [![license][license]][license]


## ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is being reworked 

The project's main purpose is helping students to organize themselves through Moodle API built in a Discord Bot with more functionalities. IF you wish to use this bot with your Moodle, contact us and we will help you to set it up.

The bot's features include:

* Music
* Moodle
* Reminder
* Profile (with level system)
* Reaction role
* General admin commands
* Fun  

## üì± Usage Example

On Discord, you can use the following commands to get Moodle assignments on a 14 days range:

```discord
<prefix> get assignments
```

`get` support _events_, _assignments_ and _classes_. However, you can obtain personal information about assignments by using `check`

```discord
<prefix> check
```

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

## üíª Development Setup

For the firsts dependencies, you need to install all requirements in ```requirements.txt``` and you must have PostgreSQL installed in your machine. For now, you need to create the ```DiscordDB``` in your default public Schema, in the future that will be changed.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
